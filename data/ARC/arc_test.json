Ultimately, any 'critic' stands or falls on self-revelation: the subject under scrutiny is as much his or her particular prejudices, enthusiasms and acuity as the work under discussion. Professional critics are crucial to cultural vitality in many ways - as champions of unfamiliar works, as stimulators of curiosity, as goads to clearer, deeper thinking about an artistic experience, to name a few.

The AMA delegates also endorsed a review of the 'risks and benefits' of new legal markets in Colorado and Washington. One of those 'benefits' is readily apparent - an average of 714 people per month were arrested in Colorado for possession in the first nine months of 2012. Arrest numbers have dropped over 80% in Colorado since legalization. Every person not arrested is a tragedy avoided. Many argue for a 'go slow' approach to legalization - exactly what we've seen for decades.

If Obama had supported that effort, every nation in the world except Israel would have voted in favor of the motion, and Israel would have gotten the message that it is time to be as seriously forthcoming as J-Street advocates. Instead, he betrayed the Palestinians and isolated the United States more forcefully than has yet become apparent. If Romney is elected, that isolation will become fully manifest.

Even then, the country feared that Russia would attempt to invade or otherwise seize its lands. The unintended message from not assisting Ukraine is that other countries will recognize the importance of nuclear weapons, and will hold on to existing arsenals or attempt to develop one.

The advantage of cameras on officers is that when implemented properly, the tape *can't* come back empty. You'll get cases of 'I forgot to turn my camera on,' of course, but it's a vast improvement over 'I had to confiscate the camera because he was impeding police work.'

Putin was emboldened by his relatively easy takeover of Crimea, at a time when the Ukrainian government was in flux. If he had waited until the May elections, he may have been able to negotiate an annexation, but Putin has shown no inclination to enter into talks as a respectful equal with nations he considers inferior to Russia -- which is the entire CIS.
